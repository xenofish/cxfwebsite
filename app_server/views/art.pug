  h1 Artist's Statement
  stuff
  |<br>There is a curve there
  |<br>Bending steel rod cold
  |<br>Clean like it wants to change
  |<br>Not like childhood doodles
  |<br>Endless scribbles never inside the lines
  |<br>
  |<br>They donâ€™t tell you that
  |<br>
  |<br>There is a strength in simplicity
  |<br>There is a strength in steel
  |<br>There is a simplicity to nature
  |<br>There is a strength in bone
  |<br>There is a simplicity in lines
  |<br>There is a simplicity to symmetry
  |<br>And a life in asymmetry
  |<br>
  |<br>That you can breathe
  |<br>Like god into clay
  |<br>Into metal
  |<br>In continuous firing
  |<br>Bending and rust
