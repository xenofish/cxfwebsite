# Colin Xeno Fish's Website

This is the code behind my website, https://ColinXenoFish.herokupapp.com
It is built with on the MEAN development stack, unabbreviated to:
M- MongoDB, a simple database language alternative to MySQL
E- Express, a framework for delivering webpages built upon Node.js
A- Angular.js, a framework for building dynamic webpages
N- Node.js, a simple Javascript runtime with an extensive open source library
It also utilizes the Pug markup language for HTML, and Bootstrap for the CSS, specifically the Amelia theme.

The website was built in no small part with help from Simon Holme's Textbook,
Getting Mean: https://github.com/simonholmes/getting-MEAN.
